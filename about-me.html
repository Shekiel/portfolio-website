          Hi! I'm a Manchester based aspiring junior software developer
          currently doing a bootcamp at Northcoders, a 14 week software
          development course with the curriculum of the fundamental and
          essential modern day engineering skills. After spending 5 years,
          working in retail I decided after talking to a friend who made the
          same career transition recommended them to me. After seeing his
          success after the bootcamp I decided to sign up!

          <br />
          <br />
          I'm a down to earth person who loves reading and has a passion for
          learning new things. I work well solo or with-in a team! Through-out
          my walks of life, i've picked up various skills from basic
          communication to newly developed coding skill.
